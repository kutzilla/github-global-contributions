329d88da4df9a96da43018aceabd3a06e6a7e7ae;[media] media: i2c: Don't export ir-kbd-i2c module alias

This is a partial revert of commit ed8d1cf07cb16d ("[media] Export I2C
module alias information in missing drivers") that exported the module
aliases for the I2C drivers that were missing to make autoload to work.

But there is a bug report [0] that auto load of the ir-kbd-i2c driver
cause the Hauppauge HD-PVR driver to not behave correctly.

This is a hdpvr latent bug that was just exposed by ir-kbd-i2c module
autoloading working and will also happen if the I2C driver is built-in
or a user calls modprobe to load the module and register the driver.

But there is a regression experimented by users so until the real bug
is fixed, let's not export the module alias for the ir-kbd-i2c driver
even when this just masks the actual issue.

f784beb75ce82f4136f8a0960d3ee872f7109e09;ALSA: timer: Fix link corruption due to double start or stop

Although ALSA timer code got hardening for races, it still causes
use-after-free error.  This is however rather a corrupted linked list,
not actually the concurrent accesses.  Namely, when timer start is
triggered twice, list_add_tail() is called twice, too.  This ends
up with the link corruption and triggers KASAN error.

The simplest fix would be replacing list_add_tail() with
list_move_tail(), but fundamentally it's the problem that we don't
check the double start/stop correctly.  So, the right fix here is to
add the proper checks to snd_timer_start() and snd_timer_stop() (and
their variants).

2cdc7b636d55cbcf42e1e6c8accd85e62d3e9ae8;ALSA: seq: Fix yet another races among ALSA timer accesses

ALSA sequencer may open/close and control ALSA timer instance
dynamically either via sequencer events or direct ioctls.  These are
done mostly asynchronously, and it may call still some timer action
like snd_timer_start() while another is calling snd_timer_close().
Since the instance gets removed by snd_timer_close(), it may lead to
a use-after-free.

This patch tries to address such a race by protecting each
snd_timer_*() call via the existing spinlock and also by avoiding the
access to timer during close call.

b248371628aad599a48540962f6b85a21a8a0c3f;ALSA: pcm: Fix potential deadlock in OSS emulation

There are potential deadlocks in PCM OSS emulation code while
accessing read/write and mmap concurrently.  This comes from the
infamous mmap_sem usage in copy_from/to_user().  Namely,

   snd_pcm_oss_write() ->
     &runtime->oss.params_lock ->
        copy_to_user() ->

  mmap() ->
    &mm->mmap_sem ->
      snd_pcm_oss_mmap() ->
        &runtime->oss.params_lock

Since we can't avoid taking params_lock from mmap code path, use
trylock variant and aborts with -EAGAIN as a workaround of this AB/BA
deadlock.

can only be built as loadable modules if V4L2 or any other of the
dependencies itself is a module.

drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-dma-contig.c:484:2:
	error: implicit declaration of function 'dma_get_cache_alignment'

The build of videobuf2-dma-contig.c depends on HAS_DMA and it is
correctly mentioned in the Kconfig but the symbol VIDEO_STI_BDISP also
selects VIDEOBUF2_DMA_CONTIG, so it is trying to compile
videobuf2-dma-contig.c even though HAS_DMA is not defined.

Some user space use cases result in kernel hangup on the HIC_OPEN_SENSOR
command write. In case when a minimalistic application is used for setting
up the streaming, the hangups occur only occasionally. In case of GStreamer
use cases it is always the case.

In order to allow for automatic media device entities linking
from the level of libv4l plugin the open system call shouldn't
fail, as the libv4l plugins can begin their job not until it
succeeds.
This patch allows for leaving the  pipeline not linked on
open and postpones verifying it to the moment when streamon
callback is called.

VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT ioctl should return TRY format previously
set with VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT. Currently it is not the case as
only ACTIVE formats are saved in the driver. Since the driver
doesn't alter hardware state in the set_fmt op anyway, the
op can save the format in both TRY and ACTIVE case.

5017e1b15d4ca8dcc170dc6914f6b2d8cd492bdf;[media] v4l: vsp1: Fix wrong entities links creation

The Media Control framework now requires entities to be registered with
the media device before creating links so commit c7621b3044f7 ("[media]
v4l: vsp1: separate links creation from entities init") separated link
creation from entities init.

But unfortunately that patch introduced a regression since wrong links
were created causing a boot failure on Renesas boards.

This patch fixes the boot issue and also the media graph was compared
by Geert Uytterhoeven to make sure that the driver changes required by
the Media Control framework next generation did not affect the graph.

The test for the qemu q35 south bridge added by commit
"39bfcd52 drm/i915: more virtual south bridge detection"
also matches on real hardware.  Having the check for
virtual systems last in the list is not enough to avoid
that ...

Refine the check by additionally verifying the pci
subsystem id to see whenever it *really* is qemu.

428398e44a2762875c01a4d5c18932f1e84fdc17;drm/i915: Remove select to deleted STOP_MACHINE from Kconfig

Commit 5bab6f60cb4d ("drm/i915: Serialise updates to GGTT with access
through GGTT on Braswell") depended upon a working stop_machine() and
so forced the selection of STOP_MACHINE. However, commit 86fffe4a61dd
("kernel: remove stop_machine() Kconfig dependency") removed the option
STOP_MACHINE from init/Kconfig and ensured that stop_machine()
universally works. Due to the order in which the patches were applied,
removing the select from DRM_I915 got lost during merging.

Remove the now obsolete select statement.

2850cfddfb052a552dfa19b75836a873e0ca1f50;drm/i915: Fix NULL plane->fb oops on SKL

In this atomic age, we can't trust the plane->fb pointer anymore.
It might get update too late. Instead we are supposed to use the
plane_state->fb pointer instead. Let's do that in
intel_plane_obj_offset() and avoid problems from dereferencing the
potentially stale plane->fb pointer.

Paulo found this with 'kms_frontbuffer_tracking --show-hidden --run-subtest nop-1p-rte'
but it can be reproduced with just plain old kms_setplane.

I was too lazy to bisect this, so not sure exactly when it broke. The
most obvious candidate
commit ce7f17285639 ("drm/i915: Fix i915_ggtt_view_equal to handle rotation correctly")
was actually still fine, so it must have broken some time after that.

Here's the resulting fireworks:

On SKL+ plane scaling is mutually exclusive with color keying. The code
check for this, but during some refactoring the code got changed to
also reject primary plane windowing when color keying is used. There is
no such restriction in the hardware, so restore the original logic.

We need to set the DC FLUSH PIPE_CONTROL bit on Gen7+ to guarantee
that writes performed via the HDC are visible in memory.  Fixes an
intermittent failure in a Piglit test that writes to a BO from a
shader using GL atomic counters (implemented as HDC untyped atomics)
and then expects the memory to read back the same value after mapping
it on the CPU.

than only API/ABI changes.  Drop those two entries, but leave
include/linux/syscalls.h and kernel/sys_ni.c to catch syscall-related

12352d3cae2cebe18805a91fab34b534d7444231;mm: replace vma_lock_anon_vma with anon_vma_lock_read/write

Sequence vma_lock_anon_vma() - vma_unlock_anon_vma() isn't safe if
anon_vma appeared between lock and unlock.  We have to check anon_vma
first or call anon_vma_prepare() to be sure that it's here.  There are
only few users of these legacy helpers.  Let's get rid of them.

This patch fixes anon_vma lock imbalance in validate_mm().  Write lock
isn't required here, read lock is enough.

And reorders expand_downwards/expand_upwards: security_mmap_addr() and
wrapping-around check don't have to be under anon vma lock.

012a4163be4559d406ed2d7f2aa459538eb8b686;um: asm/page.h: remove the pte_high member from struct pte_t

Commit 16da306849d0 ("um: kill pfn_t") introduced a compile warning for
defconfig (SUBARCH=i386):

  arch/um/kernel/skas/mmu.c:38:206:
      warning: right shift count >= width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]

Aforementioned patch changes the definition of the phys_to_pfn() macro
from

  ((pfn_t) ((p) >> PAGE_SHIFT))

to

  ((p) >> PAGE_SHIFT)

This effectively changes the phys_to_pfn() expansion's type from
unsigned long long to unsigned long.

Through the callchain init_stub_pte() => mk_pte(), the expansion of
phys_to_pfn() is (indirectly) fed into the 'phys' argument of the
pte_set_val(pte, phys, prot) macro, eventually leading to

  (pte).pte_high = (phys) >> 32;

This results in the warning from above.

Since UML only deals with 32 bit addresses, the upper 32 bits from
'phys' used to be always zero anyway.  Also, all page protection flags
defined by UML don't use any bits beyond bit 9.  Since the contents of a
PTE are defined within architecture scope only, the ->pte_high member
can be safely removed.

Remove the ->pte_high member from struct pte_t.
Rename ->pte_low to ->pte.
Adapt the pte helper macros in arch/um/include/asm/page.h.

Noteworthy is the pte_copy() macro where a smp_wmb() gets dropped.  This
write barrier doesn't seem to be paired with any read barrier though and
thus, was useless anyway.

080fe2068e1c7f19f565b30b78baf78edf16a980;mm, hugetlb: don't require CMA for runtime gigantic pages

Commit 944d9fec8d7a ("hugetlb: add support for gigantic page allocation
at runtime") has added the runtime gigantic page allocation via
alloc_contig_range(), making this support available only when CONFIG_CMA
is enabled.  Because it doesn't depend on MIGRATE_CMA pageblocks and the
associated infrastructure, it is possible with few simple adjustments to
require only CONFIG_MEMORY_ISOLATION instead of full CONFIG_CMA.

After this patch, alloc_contig_range() and related functions are
available and used for gigantic pages with just CONFIG_MEMORY_ISOLATION
enabled.  Note CONFIG_CMA selects CONFIG_MEMORY_ISOLATION.  This allows
supporting runtime gigantic pages without the CMA-specific checks in
page allocator fastpaths.

When mapcount accounting was reworked, the setting of

a result, the validation of mapcount in free_huge_page fails.

The "BUG_ON" checks in free_huge_page were also changed to

77bf45e78050790d8f7fc30b87a0ca674bf6265a;mempolicy: do not try to queue pages from !vma_migratable()

Maybe I miss some point, but I don't see a reason why we try to queue
pages from non migratable VMAs.

This testcase steps on VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() in isolate_lru_page():

    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <sys/mman.h>
    #include <numaif.h>

    #define SIZE 0x2000

    int foo;

    int main()
    {
        int fd;
        char *p;
        unsigned long mask = 2;

        fd = open("/dev/sg0", O_RDWR);
        p = mmap(NULL, SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
        /* Faultin pages */
        foo = p[0] + p[0x1000];
        mbind(p, SIZE, MPOL_BIND, &mask, 4, MPOL_MF_MOVE | MPOL_MF_STRICT);
        return 0;
    }

The only case when we can queue pages from such VMA is MPOL_MF_STRICT
plus MPOL_MF_MOVE or MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL for VMA which has pages on LRU,
but gfp mask is not sutable for migaration (see mapping_gfp_mask() check
in vma_migratable()).  That's looks like a bug to me.

Let's filter out non-migratable vma at start of queue_pages_test_walk()
and go to queue_pages_pte_range() only if MPOL_MF_MOVE or
MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL flag is set.

564e81a57f9788b1475127012e0fd44e9049e342;mm, vmstat: fix wrong WQ sleep when memory reclaim doesn't make any progress

Jan Stancek has reported that system occasionally hanging after "oom01"
testcase from LTP triggers OOM.  Guessing from a result that there is a
kworker thread doing memory allocation and the values between "Node 0
Normal free:" and "Node 0 Normal:" differs when hanging, vmstat is not
up-to-date for some reason.

According to commit 373ccbe59270 ("mm, vmstat: allow WQ concurrency to
discover memory reclaim doesn't make any progress"), it meant to force
the kworker thread to take a short sleep, but it by error used
schedule_timeout(1).  We missed that schedule_timeout() in state
TASK_RUNNING doesn't do anything.

Fix it by using schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) which forces the
kworker thread to take a short sleep in order to make sure that vmstat
is up-to-date.

wakeups from the idle context.

f01f17d3705bb6081c9e5728078f64067982be36;mm, vmstat: make quiet_vmstat lighter

Mike has reported a considerable overhead of refresh_cpu_vm_stats from
the idle entry during pipe test:

    12.89%  [kernel]       [k] refresh_cpu_vm_stats.isra.12
     4.75%  [kernel]       [k] __schedule
     4.70%  [kernel]       [k] mutex_unlock
     3.14%  [kernel]       [k] __switch_to

This is caused by commit 0eb77e988032 ("vmstat: make vmstat_updater
deferrable again and shut down on idle") which has placed quiet_vmstat
into cpu_idle_loop.  The main reason here seems to be that the idle
entry has to get over all zones and perform atomic operations for each
vmstat entry even though there might be no per cpu diffs.  This is a
pointless overhead for _each_ idle entry.

Make sure that quiet_vmstat is as light as possible.

First of all it doesn't make any sense to do any local sync if the
current cpu is already set in oncpu_stat_off because vmstat_update puts
itself there only if there is nothing to do.

Then we can check need_update which should be a cheap way to check for
potential per-cpu diffs and only then do refresh_cpu_vm_stats.

The original patch also did cancel_delayed_work which we are not doing
here.  There are two reasons for that.  Firstly cancel_delayed_work from
idle context will blow up on RT kernels (reported by Mike):

  CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 4.5.0-rt3 #7
  Hardware name: MEDION MS-7848/MS-7848, BIOS M7848W08.20C 09/23/2013
  Call Trace:
    dump_stack+0x49/0x67
    ___might_sleep+0xf5/0x180
    rt_spin_lock+0x20/0x50
    try_to_grab_pending+0x69/0x240
    cancel_delayed_work+0x26/0xe0
    quiet_vmstat+0x75/0xa0
    cpu_idle_loop+0x38/0x3e0
    cpu_startup_entry+0x13/0x20
    start_secondary+0x114/0x140

And secondly, even on !RT kernels it might add some non trivial overhead
which is not necessary.  Even if the vmstat worker wakes up and preempts
idle then it will be most likely a single shot noop because the stats
were already synced and so it would end up on the oncpu_stat_off anyway.
We just need to teach both vmstat_shepherd and vmstat_update to stop
scheduling the worker if there is nothing to do.

1f1ffb8a151e8c59899c78019f76cb8f64be13f5;memblock: don't mark memblock_phys_mem_size() as __init

At the moment memblock_phys_mem_size() is marked as __init, and so is
discarded after boot.  This is different from most of the memblock
functions which are marked __init_memblock, and are only discarded after
boot if memory hotplug is not configured.

To allow for upcoming code which will need memblock_phys_mem_size() in
the hotplug path, change it from __init to __init_memblock.

d7ce36924344ace0dbdc855b1206cacc46b36d45;dump_stack: avoid potential deadlocks

Some servers experienced fatal deadlocks because of a combination of
bugs, leading to multiple cpus calling dump_stack().

The checksumming bug was fixed in commit 34ae6a1aa054 ("ipv6: update
skb->csum when CE mark is propagated").

The second problem is a faulty locking in dump_stack()

CPU1 runs in process context and calls dump_stack(), grabs dump_lock.

   CPU2 receives a TCP packet under softirq, grabs socket spinlock, and
   call dump_stack() from netdev_rx_csum_fault().

   dump_stack() spins on atomic_cmpxchg(&dump_lock, -1, 2), since
   dump_lock is owned by CPU1

While dumping its stack, CPU1 is interrupted by a softirq, and happens
to process a packet for the TCP socket locked by CPU2.

CPU1 spins forever in spin_lock() : deadlock

Stack trace on CPU1 looked like :

af1ddcb5c63cfb9744c29e88db0bab6bb25ad76b;m32r: fix build failure due to SMP and MMU

One of the randconfig build failed with the error:

  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c:283:20: error: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector

  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c:479:41: error: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector
    unsigned long *mmc = &flush_mm->context[cpu_id];

It turned out that CONFIG_SMP was defined but CONFIG_MMU was not
defined.  But arch/m32r/include/asm/mmu.h only defines mm_context_t as
an array when both CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_MMU are defined.  And
arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c is always using context as an array.  So without
MMU SMP can not work.

Previously the pfn_mkwrite() fault handler for raw block devices called
bldev_dax_fault() -> __dax_fault() to do a full DAX page fault.

Really what the pfn_mkwrite() fault handler needs to do is call
dax_pfn_mkwrite() to make sure that the radix tree entry for the given
PTE is marked as dirty so that a follow-up fsync or msync call will
flush it durably to media.

A second set will follow shortly with ones that are.

* core in kernel interfaces
  - fix a possible NULL dereference that is a theoretical possibility
    via odd usage of iio_channel_release. Pretty much a hardening of
    the interface, but observed in the wild with the twl4030_charger
    driver.
* acpi-als
  - report the data as processed as it is in lux.  This fixes a wrong
    use of the IIO ABI.  However, old _raw version retained to avoid
    breaking any userspace in the wild that is relying on that (none
    known but it doesn't hurt us much to retain it)
* ade7753
  - fix some error handling to avoid use of unitialized data.
* ltr501
  - use a signed return type for ltr501_match_samp_freq so as to allow
    returning of an error code.
* mcp4725
  - set name field of struct iio_dev to ensure the sysfs name attribute
    doesn't give NULL.
* mpl115
  - temperature offset sign is wrong.
* stk8ba50
  - IIO_TRIGGER dependency added
* ti_am335x_adc
  - Label buffer as a software buffer. It's actually a hybrid of a
    true hardware buffer feeding a kfifo, but the meaning of these fields

4850d43143e72563556b9ba371e26b2b48599321;ARM: OMAP2+: Remove legacy mailbox device instantiation

The legacy-style mailbox device creation is supported currently
only for OMAP3, as all other SoCs are DT-boot only. Even on this
SoC, there are no client drivers that utilize these mailbox devices.
So, clean up the legacy-style mailbox device instantiation logic.
The mailbox devices are already present and supported for the DT
boot on OMAP3.

af756bbccff85504ce05c63a50f80b9d7823c500;ARM: dts: Fix omap5 PMIC control lines for RTC writes

The palmas PMIC has two control lines that need to be muxed properly
for things to work. The sys_nirq pin is used for interrupts, and msecure
pin is used for enabling writes to some PMIC registers.

Without these pins configured properly things can fail in mysterious
ways. For example, we can't update the RTC registers on palmas PMIC
unless the msecure pin is configured. And this is probably the reason
why we had RTC missing from the omap5 dts file.

According to "OMAP5430 ES2.0 Data Manual [Public] VErsion A (Rev. F)"
swps052f.pdf, mux mode 1 is for sys_drm_msecure so in theory there's
should be no need to configure it as a GPIO pin.

However, it seems there are some reliability issues using the msecure
mux mode. And the TI trees configure the msecure pin as GPIO out high
instead.

As the PMIC only cares that the msecure line is high to allow access
to the RTC registers, let's use a GPIO hog as suggested by Nishanth
Menon <nm@ti.com>. Also the use of the internal pull was considered
but supposedly that may not be capable of keeping the line high in
a noisy environment.

If we ever see high security omap5 products in the mainline tree,
those need to skip the msecure pin muxing and ignore setting the GPIO
hog. Chances are the related pin mux registers are locked in that case
and the msecure pin is managed by whatever software may be running in
the ARM TrustZone.

Who knows what the original intention of the msecure pin was. Maybe
it was supposed to prevent the system time to be set back for some
game demo modes to time out? Anyways, it seems that later PMICs like
tps659037 have recycled this pin for "powerhold" and devices like
beagle-x15 do not need changes to the msecure pin configuration.

To avoid further confusion with TWL variant PMICs, beagle-x15 does
not have a back-up battery for RTC palmas. Instead the mcp79410 RTC
is used with rtc-ds1307 driver. There is a "powerhold" jumper j5
holes near the palmas PMIC, and shorting it seems to power up
beagle-x15 automatically. It is unknown if it also has other side
effects to the beagle-x15 power up sequence.

320549a22484952d88d4e0320218765b16cd2174;regmap: mmio: Revert to v4.4 endianness handling

Commit 29bb45f25ff3 (regmap-mmio: Use native endianness for read/write)
attempted to fix some long standing bugs in the MMIO implementation for
big endian systems caused by duplicate byte swapping in both regmap and
readl()/writel() which affected MIPS systems as when they are in big
endian mode they flip the endianness of all registers in the system, not
just the CPU.  MIPS systems had worked around this by declaring regmap
using IPs as little endian which is inaccurate, unfortunately the issue
had not been reported.

Sadly the fix makes things worse rather than better.  By changing the
behaviour to match the documentation it caused behaviour changes for
other IPs which broke them and by using the __raw I/O accessors to avoid
the endianness swapping in readl()/writel() it removed some memory
ordering guarantees and could potentially generate unvirtualisable
instructions on some architectures.

Unfortunately sorting out all this mess in any half way sensible fashion
was far too invasive to go in during an -rc cycle so instead let's go
back to the old broken behaviour for v4.5, the better fixes are already
queued for v4.6.  This does mean that we keep the broken MIPS DTs for
another release but that seems the least bad way of handling the
situation.

b64e86cdf6a9d772c47b8e594dd173b86270fd1b;scripts: add "prune-kernel" script to clean up old kernel images

Long ago, Dave Jones complained about CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO:
 "I don't use the auto config, because I end up filling up /boot unless
  I go through and clean them out by hand every time I install a new one
  (which I do probably a dozen or so times a day).  Is there some easy
  way to prune old builds I'm missing?"

To which Bruce replied:
 "I run this by hand every now and then.  I'm probably doing it all wrong"

And if he is running it wrong, then so am I - because I've been using
this script ever since.  It is true that CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO easily
ends up filling your /boot partition if you don't clean up old versions
regularly, and this script helps make that easier.

Checked with Bruce to see that it's fine to add this to the kernel
scripts.  Maybe people will come up with enhancements, but more
importantly, this way I won't misplace this script whenever I install a
new machine and start doing custom kernels for it.

skcipher_async_req.

To trigger the race run the following loops simultaneously for a while:
  $ while : ; do modprobe aesni-intel; rmmod aesni-intel; done
  $ while : ; do crconf show all > /dev/null; done

Fix the race by taking the crypto_alg_sem read lock, thereby preventing
crypto_unregister_alg() from modifying the algorithm list during the
dump.

This bug has been detected by the PaX memory sanitize feature.

8244062ef1e54502ef55f54cced659913f244c3e;modules: fix longstanding /proc/kallsyms vs module insertion race.

For CONFIG_KALLSYMS, we keep two symbol tables and two string tables.
There's one full copy, marked SHF_ALLOC and laid out at the end of the
module's init section.  There's also a cut-down version that only
contains core symbols and strings, and lives in the module's core
section.

After module init (and before we free the module memory), we switch
the mod->symtab, mod->num_symtab and mod->strtab to point to the core
versions.  We do this under the module_mutex.

However, kallsyms doesn't take the module_mutex: it uses
preempt_disable() and rcu tricks to walk through the modules, because
it's used in the oops path.  It's also used in /proc/kallsyms.
There's nothing atomic about the change of these variables, so we can
get the old (larger!) num_symtab and the new symtab pointer; in fact
this is what I saw when trying to reproduce.

By grouping these variables together, we can use a
carefully-dereferenced pointer to ensure we always get one or the
other (the free of the module init section is already done in an RCU
callback, so that's safe).  We allocate the init one at the end of the
module init section, and keep the core one inside the struct module
itself (it could also have been allocated at the end of the module
core, but that's probably overkill).

4355efbd80482a961cae849281a8ef866e53d55c;modules: fix modparam async_probe request

Commit f2411da746985 ("driver-core: add driver module
asynchronous probe support") added async probe support,
in two forms:

  * in-kernel driver specification annotation
  * generic async_probe module parameter (modprobe foo async_probe)

To support the generic kernel parameter parse_args() was
extended via commit ecc8617053e0 ("module: add extra
argument for parse_params() callback") however commit
failed to f2411da746985 failed to add the required argument.

This causes a crash then whenever async_probe generic
module parameter is used. This was overlooked when the
form in which in-kernel async probe support was reworked
a bit... Fix this as originally intended.

CONFIG_INPUT may itself be a loadable module, but the sirf power key
driver is listed as 'bool', which makes it possible to select
a broken configuration with the driver built-in but the subsystem
not loaded. In this configuration, we get a link error:

This marks the driver as 'tristate' so it becomes possible to have
it in a loadable module, mainly to help with randconfig builds.

We also have to add a missing semicolon here, which ended up not
being needed in built-in mode because the following MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
is an empty macro followed by another semicolon then.
